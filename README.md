# CPS514-chord-experiments

This is my course project for CPS514: Computer Networking. My partner, Chan Hwang, and I will implement the Chord distributed lookup service as described in https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=383071

Check out the [chord](https://github.com/JEHoctor/CPS514-chord-experiments/tree/chord) and [chord-dev-mininet-vm-compat](https://github.com/JEHoctor/CPS514-chord-experiments/tree/chord-dev-mininet-vm-compat) branches.
